   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   npm install
   ```

**Configuration:**

- Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   ```

**Usage:**

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node index.js

  "name": "Product 1",
  "quantity": 10,
  "price": 9.99
}'
